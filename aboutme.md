My name is JK. For now. Setting up yet another blog like thousands of others more to gather my thoughts and and useful tips in one palce, rather than have it scaterred acorss my gist, pastebin and evernote accounts. I figured it'd be useful for others too. Actually I've not yet decided what this site will turn out to be, so let's see where this leads us.

### My history

I work in the IT sector in Big Data and business intelligence (14 years), but this site isn't necessarily about those areas.
